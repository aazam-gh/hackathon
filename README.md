# ðŸš€ GraphQL Conf Hackathon 2024 | Tailcall

## Objective

The idea is to implement the fastest GraphQL server with the following schema:

```graphql
schema {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]
  post(id: Int!): Post
  users: [User]
  user(id: Int!): User
}

type Post {
  id: Int
  userId: Int!
  title: String
  body: String
  user: User
}

type User {
  id: Int
  name: String
  username: String
  email: String
  address: Address
  phone: String
  website: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Address {
  zipcode: String
  geo: Geo
}

type Geo {
  lat: Float
  lng: Float
}
```

## Technical Requirements

1. All CI tests should pass.
2. Your implementation should be under the `/projects` directory.

## Additional Requirements

1. Your implementation has to be the fastest amongst all the contributors.
2. Any kind of plagiarism will result in a ban, checkout our [guidelines](https://tailcall.run/docs/contributors/bounty/#identifying-plagiarism) on plagiarism for more.

## And Some More...

- We might add new tests and modify the existing ones to ensure its there is no hardcoding and its a level playing field for all.
- If you questions or doubts about the hackathon, connect with us on [Discord] or [Twitter] or the only two people in that bright yellow T-Shirt they'd be glad to say ðŸ‘‹.
